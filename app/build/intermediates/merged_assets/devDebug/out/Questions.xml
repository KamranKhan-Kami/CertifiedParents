        <Q>When will a child’s mind start developing?</Q>

        <D>Even though a baby’s brain starts developing inside the womb, it lacks the sensory stimulation necessary for neuronal development for complexities of the mind. However, the child’s developing ears can hear muffled sounds from the mother’s body and her voice and other sense organs transfer some information to the baby’s brain.
            The human mind begins t
            o form when the baby is born and starts sensing, experiencing and learning from its environment and experiences.</D>

        <D>This is a very common concern of some parents. They fear that maternal stressors will affect the developing baby’s mind. The human nervous system in its most rudimentary form start starts forming at about 4 weeks of pregnancy. However, the fetal developing nervous system is in no way directly connected to the mother’s brain. Stressful life events are common in pregnancy and unless there are continuous stressors throughout pregnancy that can raise maternal stress hormones, the developing fetal brain will be spared.
            However, a mother’s food habits, medicines and anything that enters her bloodstream can also reach fetal circulation and can affect the baby’s development.</D>

        <Q>When do children start observing others?</Q>

        <I>3.jpg</I>
        <D>When first born, a baby’s eyesight is not fully formed. A few weeks after birth, the baby can process complex visual stimuli and starts preferentially looking at faces. Observing faces gives way to imitation. If Dad sticks out his tongue and makes a face, the baby’s brain tries to reciprocate. This is a good time to start showing the baby things like pictures of faces of the people in their life.
            Imagine a few-months-old baby in the mother’s arms while an unexpected visitor arrives. Even though it’s too early for the infant to understand what they are saying, the baby keeps looking from the stranger’s face to its mother, back and forth. The baby is trying to understand the conversation from their facial expression. Finally, when the stranger is about to leave and extends his arms to welcome the baby, gesturing to the child to ask whether it would like to come to them, the first thing the baby does is to look at their mother’s face. Only if the mother gives a warm positive gesture will the baby reciprocate.
            Hence, parents must be very careful when they are in the company of their children. However small the infant maybe, you are being observed.</D>

        <Q>If you leave your small baby all of a sudden</Q>
        <A>	She will start crying instantly </A>
        <B>	She will be confused and forget </B>
        <C>	She will keep searching for her mother</C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>4.jpg</I>
        <D>Smaller babies do not have a concept of what developmental psychologists call ‘object permanence’: that is believing an object ceases to exist when it disappears from sight. In psychological experiments when a favorite toy was presented to an infant and then was covered with a blanket, an infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused and think the toy has suddenly disappeared.
            So, when you play peek-a-boo with your baby and you cover your face, they baby gets anxious, as it thinks your face disappeared and he can’t figure out it's behind your palms. When you remove your hand, the baby is excited to see your face appear from nowhere.
            This also explains why smaller infants do not cry when the mother leaves suddenly (because for the baby, out of sight means out of mind!) while an older child may frantically start searching for the mother.</D>

        <D>Usually, only infants and smaller children enjoy playing peek-a-boo. This is because smaller babies do not have a concept of what developmental psychologists call ‘object permanence’: that is believing an object ceases to exist when it disappears from sight. In psychological experiments when a favorite toy was presented to an infant and then was covered with a blanket, an infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy.

        <Q>At what age does a child lose his innocence?</Q>
        <A>	When he starts observing grown-ups behavior</A>
        <B>	When he can guess what others are feeling </B>
        <C>	When he start acting like grown-ups </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>6.jpg</I>
        <D>Before 3 years, your child believes that everything revolves around him. He is the center of her world. He cannot see from other’s perspective. This is the age of innocence when they can’t lie. In order to lie, the child needs to understand what the other person is thinking. Very young children, especially before 3 years of age, may find it psychologically difficult to formulate and tell a lie.
            After around 3 to 4 yrs., children have the psychological development to think from another person’s perspective and will know that to escape someone’s fields of vision he will have to hide under a piece of furniture or behind the wall, and so he starts enjoying hide and seek. In the same way, only when he reaches the age to understand what others might be thinking, he starts lying.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>Why your 3-year-old doesn’t seem to bother when you explain that you are tired from office?</Q>
        <A>	He can’t understand that you are tired </A>
        <B>	He is too much excited to listen </B>
        <C>	They need your attention and not an excuse</C>
        <R>A</R>
        <I>7.jpg</I>
        <D>So, when a child starts enjoying games like hide and seek, it means they are psychologically able to understand from another’s perspective. Only now can they understand your emotions. For example, your three-year-old wants you to carry him and doesn’t seem to understand when you tell him that you are very tired. He cannot see from your perspective and thinks if he is happy while being carried by the mother, his mother should also be happy. Similarly, he will not understand when you say, “do you know how angry mummy is at your mischief?”
            When psychological development matures enough so he can see other’s viewpoints, he will try to develop positive feelings towards others, like empathy.</D>

        <I>8.jpg</I>
        <D>Before 3 years, your child believes that everything revolves around him. He is the center of her world. He cannot see from other’s perspective. Children at this age when want to hide will just cover their eyes themselves. When they close their eyes and find darkness they believe that others are also in darkness and can’t find them. So, they won’t understand the need for hiding from other’s field of vision.
            After around 3 to 4 yrs., children have the psychological development to think from another person’s perspective and will know that to escape someone’s fields of vision he will have to hide under a piece of furniture or behind the wall, and so he starts enjoying hide and seek.</D>

        <Q>If your child boldly admits his mischief</Q>
        <A>	You will be happy </A>
        <B>	You will be sad </B>
        <C>	You will be angry </C>
        <R>A</R>
        <I>9.jpg</I>
        <D>Definitely not. You should let your child know what he did really disturbs you, but at the same time, you are PROUD that he finally decided, to tell the truth. This will make the child understand that you are definitely not happy with his deed, but at the same time, he will be happy that he told the truth.  You can conclude by saying that you are pretty sure that he will not make the same mistake again.
            Remember that it's much easier for a child to tell a lie, but it takes lots of courage to admit the truth.</D>

        <Q>When I see my teen child crying</Q>
        <A>	Don’t cry dear, we are there for you </A>
        <B>	What’s there to cry, life is hard </B>
        <C>	Now that you have finished crying, let’s talk</C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>10.jpg</I>
        <D>Well, you are like every other parent. Nobody likes to see their children cry. But sometimes parents become oversensitive to the extent that they feel their children should not have any physical or psychological pain, which is not healthy.
            When a child learns to walk, he will fall down and cry. Initially, parents will respond to the call and support the child. Slowly the parental support is deliberately brought down and parents will think that the child should be left alone and he should learn from each fall. The child then learns to find balance and further advance his motor milestones.
            But a similar response does not happen in the case of psychological pain. When children cry the parents’ immediate response is to stop it without delay and they try to suppress the normal emotional expression of pain. Only when the child cries and expresses the pain will he understands that such psychological trauma is also part of life and thereby learns to overcome such emotional states by himself.
            Hence, it would be better if parents facilitated natural emotional expression and once the child has stopped crying, they can talk to her and give her their support and encourage her to talk about it.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>Why do children lie?</Q>
        <A> Due to fear </A>
        <B> Can’t differentiate between Truth and Lies</B>
        <C> Don’t know the value of honesty </C>
        <R>A</R>
        <I>11.jpg</I>
        <D>Children may lie for a reason or rarely for fun. When they lie for a reason it's either for achieving some sort of advantage, but mostly is done to avoid harsh consequences. The latter can be something the child fears, such as physical punishment or loss of privileges.
            For example, imagine that your child is handling a precious crockery (maybe helping you with some housework you were doing). But accidentally it falls down and breaks. Now if the parent's response is too harsh, the next time a similar accident happens, the child will make sure that you will never find out. Maybe he will lie. This will make him understand that with a lie he will be safe, but if you tell the truth the consequences can be devastating. Remember, it may be difficult to fix a broken crockery. But it's definitely harder to repair a shattered young mind.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>You are visiting your friend’s house. Your 6 year old son likes  a showpiece in your friend’s cupboard and pleads to take  it home</Q>
        <A>	Let him have it </A>
        <B>	Ask  your child to request your friend</B>
        <C>	You will ask the child to keep it back </C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>12.jpg</I>
        <D>This is a very common situation faced by every parent at least once.
            You are visiting a friend/relative. A toy or showpiece in their apartment gets his attention. He asks for it and it is happily given to him by the friend/relative. Now after playing with it for some time, the time has come to say goodbye. Your child now wants to take it with him home. You ask the child to give it back, but that’s not well taken. Now your friend also stands by your child’s wish and is very eager to facilitate the demand. You are helpless as he also starts to plead in favour of the child.
            Now if you meet the child’s demand, you can expect a similar behaviour at your next visit too.
            What you should do is to let the child know that he is not supposed to expect other’s belongings however much he likes them. You can firmly ask the child to return it and if he doesn’t, you can do it yourself. Don’t tell the child something like you will buy another one on the way home. You can tell your friend that if you permit this now, the child will do the same thing in a similar environment later when it will be more difficult.
            Even though your child may not be happy with the way you broke his heart, he will be leaving the place having learned an important lesson in life.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>To teach a child something new, you will</Q>
        <A>	Give him lots of lessons </A>
        <B>	Give him an experience </B>
        <C>	Ask him lots of questions and explain practically</C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>13.jpg</I>
        <D>Most parents complain about this. They feel tired of giving the same lesson and advice day after day, while their child does not seem to comply.
            The reason for this is simply children do not learn from your advice, class or lectures, but they do learn from experiences. If you must teach your child a behavior, simply telling them to do what you like will not suffice. You have to make the child experience the behavior and its positive outcome.
            For example, imagine a parent always advises his child never to lie. But to avoid a call, if the father asks his child to answer the phone and tell the lie that his parent is away from home, all that advice has become ineffective just with a single experience.
            Remember, one experience is more powerful than a thousand lectures for a child.</D>

        <R>A</R>
        <I>14.jpg</I>
        <D>A child’s behavior is shaped, modified and reinforced by the environment. When a child exhibits a behavioural problem in several environments he is in, the problem might be with the child.  If a child has problems only in a particular environment and is well behaved elsewhere, the problem is with the environment.
            If the child’s behavior is problematic only within the family, parents need to find out what is the problem in the family atmosphere that makes the child’s behavior unmanageable and make necessary modifications.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>What does a child like most?</Q>
        <A>	Chocolates </A>
        <B>	Toys </B>
        <C>	Care </C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>15.jpg</I>
        <D>Most parents believe that their child likes chocolates, toys or other material things the most. But psychological experiments prove otherwise.
            Harry Harlow, a renowned American psychologist, conducted a world famous psychological experiment. He used primate monkey babies to study the effects of early parent-baby interactions and bonding.  He separated newborn monkeys from their mothers soon after birth and reared them under laboratory environments.
            In the place of the biological mother, these newborn baby monkeys were presented with two dummy mothers: a cloth mother and a wire mother. The wire mother had a feeding bottle attached to it which always delivered milk whenever the baby came to it. The cloth mother had no food dispensing bottle but had large eyes, a monkey-like face, and a soft feel.
            It was observed that in a 24-hour period, that the baby monkey spent18 hours on the cloth mother, and less than 1hour on the wire mother.  Obviously, the monkey visited the wire mother only to feed and seemed more attached to the soft mother.
            Hence this experiment showed that more than the food or milk, what is important for psychological development in babies is physical contact, emotional warmth and attention.
            The attention, time and care you give to children are far more important than any material rewards like chocolates or toys.</D>

        <Q>Adamant or stubborn behavior in a child</Q>
        <A>	Is slowly shaped by past experiences </A>
        <B>	Can develop all of a sudden in any child </B>

        <I>16.jpg</I>
        <D>Obstinate behavior in children is a difficult to manage problem that can be problematic for any unexpecting parent. An obstinate child is not born in a day. It is a behavior formed and shaped through continuous experiences.
            Imagine your child is demanding something which you don’t want him to have. As he gets more irritated he expresses his anguish and distress as physical symptoms like crying, stamping and so on. Now, if you change your mind and become permissive, the child learns that if he converts his anger into physical expressions which are easier than verbal communications, his demands are met. Next time it becomes easier for him. If you don’t give in easily, he just acts more obstinate and demanding, therefore a demanding behavior slowly begins to get shaped and the child starts to use it more often to get his way.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>A child who is rolling and throwing a tantrum in a supermarket demanding a candy or toy does so because</Q>
        <A>	He is playing with his parent’s emotions</A>
        <B>	He learned so from previous experience </B>
        <C>	He knows the parent  will get embarrassed </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>17.jpg</I>
        <D>This is one of the most embarrassing situations for any parent in public places. Though commonly seen in supermarkets and toy shops, it can happen with an obstinate child anywhere.
            You cannot criticize the child for his behaviour. He is being tormented by innumerable advertisements on media about things he likes. He can’t resist them. He is also seeing you buying whatever you want from the store, so it’s natural for the child to express his demand too.  Since kids at a very young age do not know the value of money, they don’t understand your explanation either.
            Now as a parent, to avoid the embarrassment, if you are buying the child what he is demanding, two things will happen. The child gets a lot of attention from onlookers while he is emerging a winner (everybody gives him a smiling face). Secondly, he gets rewarded with the material he asked for. You are happy because you avoided an embarrassment, but you have taught him an important lesson. Next time when he needs something really bad, he just has to repeat the same tantrum.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>If your child suddenly starts demanding for a toy and throws a tantrum in a crowded supermarket.</Q>
        <A>	You will save your face </A>
        <B>	You will try convincing the child</B>
        <C>	You will ignore the behavior  </C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>18.jpg</I>
        <D>You should do exactly opposite what the child expects. He wants your attention and to meet his demand. The opposite you must do is to ignore him and move away. Don’t stand there and try arguing with the child. This is a form of negative attention and moreover, your child is in no mood to listen to your preaching.
            What you have to do will require a lot of courage as a parent. Just ignore the tantrum, and finish the shopping and walk away (of course, you are not leaving him, but giving him a message).
            The child will soon find out that his parent is in no way interested in his demand and is almost at the exit. The crying will soon give way to anxiety and then to despair. If you are a keen observer of child behavior, you will see lots of angry parents leaving the store and a crying child following the parent to the parking lot. Try to be such a parent.
            Remember, no child throws a tantrum inside a supermarket, when his parent is not around. Behind every tantrum, there will be a parent who gives him attention.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>Giving punishment to children for a wrong behaviour</Q>
        <A>	Will stop  the behaviour </A>
        <B>	Will not stop the behaviour </B>
        <C>	Will facilitate the behaviour </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>19.jpg</I>
        <D>Psychological studies discourage physical punishments for several reasons. Firstly, physical punishments only SUPPRESS a behavior and don’t ELIMINATE it. They ensure the behavior is temporarily not expressed, but don’t remove it forever. For example, imagine a parent finds out his child has taken money from his wallet. If the parent decides to respond with physical punishment, the child might not give up the habit. Rather, he would ensure that next time when he does it, his father would never find it out.
            Moreover, psychological studies have shown that physical punishment teaches children that it is all right to harm someone less powerful than you if the latter does not comply with your ideology. Over time it can promote aggression in children and increase the chances of bad conduct and other behavioral problems.</D>
    </question>

    <question>
        <Q>What is more effective to change a child’s behaviour?</Q>
        <A>	Physical punishment </A>
        <B>	Non-physical punishment </B>
        <C>	Every day reminders </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>20.jpg</I>
        <D>Though physical punishments are to be avoided, nonphysical forms of punishments can be used and are found to be effective.
            For example, many kids would happily prefer getting spanked than not be allowed to watch their favourite cartoon.  Loss of privileges is more effective than physical punishment if used in the right manner.
            You can give a warning that, if the behavior is repeated, the child will be permitted to watch television for only half an hour instead of the usual hour.  Most children will comply if they learn that you mean what you say.</D>

    <question>
        <Q>Younger children love rewards</Q>
        <A>	Which are expensive </A>
        <B>	They are not influenced by value</B>
        <C>	Which are unique </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>21.jpg</I>
        <D>Rewarding children for good behavior is another option. Instead of punishing for an unwanted behavior, you give rewards for a wanted behavior. Rewards can be material rewards like gifts or non-material rewards like praise, hugs or even a pat. What is important is not the value of the reward, but the recognition it serves.</D>
    </question>

    <question>
        <Q>If you want to change your child’s  bad behavior with some reward</Q>
        <A>	You  will give him a candy every time he behaves well</A>
        <B>	You  will reward him with an unlimited ice cream on weekend</B>
        <C>	You will not use reward as it acts as a bribe </C>
        <R>A</R>
        <I>22.jpg</I>
        <D>Firstly, the timing is important. Rewards or punishments are more effective when given immediately following the behavior. For example, if you want to give a toffee to the child for eating all his dinner, then give it immediately after the food is finished. Don’t tell the child who has completed the behavior as expected that the candy jar is empty and you will reward him tomorrow after buying more when you go shopping.
            Secondly, small frequent rewards are more effective than bigger rewards served rarely. For example, giving candy every day, for a good behavior is far less effective than saving them for an ice cream at the end of the month.
            Lastly, the frequency of rewards should be reduced once the behavior has started to take shape and can slowly be replaced by social rewards. For example, the toffees given every day can be reduced once he has learned to eat without spilling food and can be slowly replaced by praise.</D>

        <Q>What is the best gift you have given to your child ever?</Q>

        <B>	Its cost nothing </B>
        <C>	I will always buy him the best</C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>23.jpg</I>
        <D>Remember the famous monkey baby experiment by the American psychologist Harlow. It showed that baby monkeys preferred mothers who gave comfort/attachment more than those which gave milk/food. Similarly, children like nonmaterial things like attention more than material things like food. You can give attention in the form of quality time you spent with the child, talking to them with good eye contact, encouraging the good things they do, acknowledging even small achievements they make and so on.
            However busy you may be, if you can spare a few minutes every day for your child that is the biggest gift you can give him/her.</D>

        <D>If you are a parent who wants to lend a hand and supervise every activity the child does, it may not benefit the child in the long run. Such parents are called helicopter parents. They are like choppers that always hover above. These baby-boomer parents enjoy practices such as calling and complaining to their professors about grades the children have received. They take their children everywhere with them (or follow them everywhere/keep an eye on them all the time), and are involved in all their decision making, not giving them adequate space to explore and expand on their own. For example, with the same apprehension of sending the kids to their first day at school, these parents take them to their high school competitive exams. They don’t let their high school son hang a Christmas star, but will confidently see him off for a professional course abroad in the next semester.
            The problem with helicopter type of parenting style is that there will be sudden unexpected situations in life, when the child is faced with an otherwise insignificant stressor and the parent won’t be there. They will have poor coping skills and are easily vulnerable to stressors.
            Parents should encourage age appropriate independent activities under supervision, and never try being helicopter style parents.</D>

        <Q>Giving rewards to children frequently</Q>
        <A>	Rewards slowly make them learn  bribe </A>
        <B>	Rewards  can never be a bribe </B>
        <C>	Will make them expect a favour for everything in future</C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>25.jpg</I>
        <D>Many parents wonder what the difference is between a bribe and a reward.  Some might worry that frequent rewards, may lead the child to expect a similar favour every time and make it feel like a bribe. After all, in both instances, your child is getting something for doing what you want him to do.
            Both rewards and bribes offer something in exchange for the desired behavior, but the way they are delivered makes the difference. Rewards are planned ahead of time and are delivered after a behavior is achieved. But bribes generally happen when you unexpectedly make use of them to avoid a crisis. For example, you are in a queue awaiting patiently for your turn and you realize that your child who is anxious is about to have a meltdown. The moment she starts to misbehave, you reach for the nearby shelf and offer her a lollipop, reminding her to “Take this and be quiet.”  This is something on the spot, without any rules, a form of compromising with the child. This is a Bribe.</D>

        <D>Rewards need not be something material. Praises, words of encouragement, hugs and pats are examples of non-material rewards. Some times more than the bonus, words of appreciation from one’s superior is what motivates one more. If at all parents are buying rewards for promoting a good behavior they should try to substitute them  with nonmaterial rewards in the long run.</D>

        <B>	He has no other choice except to listen</B>
        <C>	Give encouragement when he listens</C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>27.jpg</I>
        <D>Most parents complain that their children will not listen to them. But the question is how many parents would listen to their children when they badly expect them to listen? How many of us will switch off the television and put the remote aside to listen to the child in the midst of a favorite soccer match or a prime-time reality series? We may not do justice to the child in many instances because we have more interesting and engaging activities in the same moment.
            The child should learn that listening to the parent is a positive experience. Parents ask children a dozen things in a day. They may do half of these the way the parent wanted and the remaining not to their expectation. The parent will not say a good word about the tasks the child achieved and will criticize his mistakes. This causes the overall experience for the child to be negative. This will not work for anyone, especially for children.
            To make the child listen, you have to engage with them in a more interesting way. If the child feels that listening to the parent is more interesting and rewarding, he will listen. This means the parent must give the child good eye contact, more emotional attachment, praise and encouragement.</D>

        <R>B</R>
        <I>28.jpg</I>
        <D>Some parents say that children do not follow a task despite their repeated instructions. Their lectures fall on deaf ears.  The reason is simple, children learn from experience rather than lectures. This is true for not just one child, but an entire group of children.
            To substantiate this an example from an experience of school in India is worth mentioning. A school in the northern part of India found that their students were wasting drinking water despite regular reminders. They were using water more than required and were not closing taps after use. They gave children classes about the importance of saving water. ‘Save water’ notices were displayed in the wash area.  Nothing worked.
            Later they tried something different. They kept large containers near the exit at several places. Before going home, the children had to empty the water remaining in their water bottles into the collecting container. Before this, that water was being wasted by the students themselves on their way home. Next day, the water saved in the large collection vessels was used to water the plants inside the school campus by the students themselves. Within a few days of this exercise, the wastage of water in the school came down.
            This simple example proves that more than explaining, lecturing and advising children and giving them an experience will be more effective.</D>

        <Q>When my 10 year old child asks for pocket money</Q>
        <A>	I will buy you what you want </A>
        <B>	I will start a bank account instead</B>
        <C>	Ok, but don’t spend it all </C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>29.jpg</I>
        <D>It is a good habit to give children pocket money provided it is delivered wisely. This can be started at an age when they understand the value of money and start asking for money to buy things they want. If they are given money whenever they ask for it, they will never understand the value of money.
            They can be given fixed allowances on a weekly basis which they have to split into three areas: 50% for spending, 40% for saving and 10% for charity. So, they should have two piggy banks; one for savings and the other for charity.  Now if they want something expensive for a future date, the parent can always remind them to save for it because if the child has to earn it they will better understand the value of money. This is much better than the parent being a passive money bank dispensing money whenever the child demands it.
            Also, as they must wait for something more valuable they learn delayed gratification and the reward of patience. When they save enough money to buy something they have waited for, they will also spend the saved amount for charity. By this, they also learn the value and joy of sharing.</D>

        <D>Children live in the present moment. For them there is no tomorrow or next time.  To add to this, they are hyperactive, explorative and restless by nature. Moreover, parents now are liberal with the nuclear families and single child giving them more purchasing power. Parents have an innate tendency to meet the demands of the child without delay. This leads to a dangerous phenomenon called ‘instant gratification’.
            Living in the present moment is the reason for their happiness. They have no worry about their loss or anticipations about what the future has in store. But living in the present also means meeting demands instantly and being unable to wait for tomorrow.
            Buying children things they ask for without much delay leads to instant gratification, which will be a disadvantage for such parents in the long run. The reason for this will be addressed soon.</D>

        <Q>What decides my child’s long-term success more?</Q>

        <B>	His IQ </B>
        <C>	His marks </C>
        <R>A</R>
        <I>31.jpg</I>
        <D>This is a million-dollar question for any parent. Most parents believe that intelligence is a predictor of long-term achievement of their child, but there are more powerful factors that come into play.
            In 1972, a famous study was done at the Stanford university led by Psychologist Walter Mischel about delayed gratification in children. Children of 5 to 6 years of age were observed one by one in a closed room where the psychologists left them with a marshmallow. They were told that they could have the marshmallow, but if they could resist having it till the psychologist returned, they would be given two marshmallows. Children who had instant gratification failed the experiment, while those who could resist having the marshmallow for a later benefit were found to have delayed gratification.
            In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who could wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by educational attainment, and other life measures.
            Resilience and perseveration are other qualities in children that are attributed to long-term success. Hence, parents should teach children delayed gratification, patience, coping with crisis and the joy of waiting for something better.</D>

        <Q>A strict parent</Q>
        <A>	Teaches discipline in the child</A>
        <B>	Will raise confident children  </B>
        <C>	Make the child a bad decision maker in future</C>
        <R>C</R>
        <I>32.jpg</I>
        <D>Strict parents always want children to follow their advice and instructions and will not entertain the child questioning and reasoning with them. Everything goes by rules the parents set and there is not much space for any opinion. It’s like “either my way or the highway (either you listen to me, or you can leave my house).”
            If you follow such strict parenting, you lose many things as a parent. One important aspect of successful parenting is the communication and emotional attachment between parent and child. When you are a strict parent, the child may not share with you many things that he may share otherwise. Also, when they are made to follow what is being said, children will always tend to be suggestible. They find it hard to make independent decisions in life. In a similar situation in the future, when they are instructed to do something by an authority figure, such children may comply without thinking.
            Parents should encourage children to think independently, share their opinions without fear, listen to them patiently and encourage it if found reasonable enough.</D>

        <D>Children love to play socially and parents need to encourage it considering children are getting addicted to handheld devices. Social games are those activities which help children to relate socially and identify themselves with real life roles. When promoting social games, parents should try to avoid games which generate happiness by hurting a fellow being like shooting and war games. Instead games which help to develop positive emotional feelings in the child like medical sets can be selected. These are social games which help children identify others sufferings, empathize with them; help them and finally receive satisfaction from the whole experience. Similarly for girls, kitchen sets are ideal social toys which encourage them in adapting social roles and serve food to hungry baby dolls.</D>

        <D>According to gynecologists’, it will take a whole 3 years after normal delivery for the uterus and pelvic organs to regain its previous state. Another concern is the age of the mother at the time of conception. Babies have increased risk for malformations and genetic disorders if the age of mother is above 35 years. For fathers the ideal upper age limit is 40 years. The elder child will have the psychological development to think from others perspective after 4 to 5 years. Around this time, he will be able to understand his sibling more. Parents can arrive at a decision after taking all the above facts into consideration.</D>

        <D>It’s not the amount of time that you spend with your child that matter, rather the quality of that time. That is the ‘quality’ of parenting is more important than the ‘quantity’ (hours of time spent). So even if you are the only parent, if you compensate that with the quality of your care, it will be as good as any other parent.
            Some parents may not be physically present with their children, being away for work or other reasons. But they will ensure to call their children daily and talk to them about their every day experiences. This may be more beneficial than parents who are physically available all the time, but communicate little with children.</D>

        <D>As discussed earlier what children like most is positive attention. Positive attention is normally expected from those within the family. If the amount of attention from within the family is very less for a child and if he feels that he is able to get more attention and appreciation from elsewhere, the child may get emotionally attached to people outside the family. This emotional attachment can be healthy or sometimes unhealthy. Unhealthy emotional attachment outside the family can lead to several unwanted problems including premature relationships.</D>

        <D>Sibling rivalry is a term used to describe the negative emotions developing in a child immediately following the birth of the younger child. This usually happens within the first 6 months after the arrival of second child, when the parental care is naturally enhanced towards the new born baby. Parents have to be careful in the way they influence the emotional bonding between siblings. Involving the elder child in the care of his younger sibling under supervision, giving him small responsibilities and encouraging his active participation will all work towards a future harmonious relationship between siblings. Similarly, sensitive critical comments and comparison between siblings are best avoided at least in their presence</D>

        <D>IQ  and EQ are two different capacities  of brain. While IQ is the measure of one’s intelligence, EQ is the reflection of one’s ability to assess, handle and process emotions. If intelligence is necessary for ones academic and intellectual success, it’s the Emotional quotient that determines how far one succeeds in the social realm of life. Children with higher EQ will grow up to be good with social relationships, understanding others feelings, and maintaining good family relationships. Their ability to adjust socially to workplace and family will ensure that they enjoy life and keep people round them happy.
            Developmental milestones are important for both the physical and psychological development of the child, but not related to success in social life.</D>

        <C>	Permissive parenting style </C>
        <R>B</R>
        <I>39.jpg</I>
        <D>Parents who are very strict usually want their children to follow their instruction without questioning. They feel that their advices and instructions are to be followed because they are the authority in the family. They believe all orders are to be followed and should not invite any questions. Any failure to comply with their rules usually attracts severe punishments. This type of parent-centered style of parenting is known as Authoritarian parenting style. Children of such strict parents grow up to be more suggestible, less social competence, lack confidence in decision making, tend to self-blame and has increased risk for depression.
            Authoritative parenting style is the child-centered approach where children have the freedom to think rationally and make opinions. They encourage children to be independent, but give supervision and set limits/boundaries. Punishments are rarely used and often the child is permitted to experience the natural negative consequences of its unwanted behavior. Less of physical punishment is used and more importance is given to positive reinforcement and rewards. Children of authoritative parents grow up to have a positive outlook, successful in life and good decision makers.
            Parents following permissive parenting style, allow children to make decisions without their active intervention. They avoid any forms of confrontation and their children grow up with little discipline and poor self control.</D>

        <I>40.jpg</I>
        <D>This is a mistake most parents make. They try to assess their child’s friends by how well they fare in academics alone. However parents should give more importance to the development of child’s personality where friendship and peer pressure has much influence. Rather than giving importance to a child’s academic performance, their character formation should be of more concern to the parent. Character is what remains, when a person looses everything in life. A child who is kind, willing to help others and empathetic will be a good friend to your child. He will influence your child’s personality formation in a positive way.</D>

        <R>A</R>
        <I>41.jpg</I>
        <D>Most parents equate lack of obedience to character deterioration. But disobedience may also result from a child’s longing for becoming independent. When a child does not want to comply with a parent’s suggestions, the reason for non compliance should also be enquired into. Disobedience may also be influenced by the child’s mood, emotions and opinions. Children should be encouraged to pay due respect to others especially elders. Parents can be role models and children will naturally follow. For example offering ones seat in a crowded metro for an elderly person, will be more worth than a thousand advices.
            On the contrary, lack of guilt or remorse is something that every parent should worry about. Children can make mistakes and may lie to prevent getting caught. But when they are found out, and enquired about their deed, most of them feel guilt and sorry for themselves. But children with conduct disorder and antisocial personality traits may refuse to accept their mistake and if at all they do, they never feel sorry for the act. Lack of remorse or guilt is one important feature of children with possible underlying deterioration in character.</D>

        <R>A</R>
        <I>42.jpg</I>
        <D>Some parents encourage children forming friendships with people much elder to them. They feel that attachment to an elderly figure will make them more mature and wiser. It’s seen that children who have lower intelligence form friendship easily with children younger to them, and children with higher IQ may find it more comfortable with people older to them. But forming emotional attachment with a person much older to oneself need not always have positive benefits. Sometimes it can result in age inappropriate social norms in a child of developmental age. It’s not rare to see children with conduct disorder forming friendships with older adults. Hence if children form attachment to others much older in age, parents should ensure that their character formation is not influenced by age inappropriate social behaviours.</D>

        <R>B</R>
        <I>43.jpg</I>
        <D>Gradual deterioration of academic functioning is a reflection of one’s intellectual functioning. Children with lower IQ may not be able to perform as good as their peers. This may be go unnoticed  in the early part of their schooling. However it may come to attention towards the later part of schooling when the academic demand from the part of the child is higher. IQ is an almost static indicator of intelligence and can be seldom changed with will.
            On the other hand a child who was doing well in class previously, but has recent deterioration in academic functioning will require further evaluation.</D>

        <R>B</R>
        <I>44.jpg</I>
        <D>Most adults think children are always happy and never have any significant worries. But what they fail to realize is that just like adults’ children also have a brain and is not immune to problems. They also have stressors like problems at school, family and real life events. Sometimes common situations like change of school, separation of a friend or demise of a grandparent can be a significant  stressor for the child.
            When adults are depressed, they will approach another adult who is close to them or a professional mental health worker to share their problem. But this is not the case with small children. Younger children are poor communicators and they are not going to approach an adult or parent and let them know that they are having a problem. Parents and teachers have to watch for subtle changes in the child’s behaviour. One significant change to watch out for is decreased interest in previously interested activities. Examples are decreased interest in going to class, not using playtime as before, less interest for previously enjoyed foods, and decreased interest in television time. Children may also express increased irritability and lack of concentration in class.
            Hence a parent has to look for changes in the child’s behaviour and not wait for the child to express his distress which may be unlikely.</D>

        <R>C</R>
        <I>45.jpg</I>
        <D>ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a very common childhood problem that affects about 5% of preschool children. Which means roughly one out of 20 students in a class will have the problem. It is commoner in boys. Children with ADHD will present with three main symptoms:  hyperactivity poor concentration and impulsivity.
            Hyperactivity is evident as inability to keep still especially in a distractible environment.  These children appear as if they are driven by a motor. They will squirm and fidget in their seat and will be restless if made to stay calm.
            Difficulty in concentration will be evident more in class. They need repeated reminders from teachers to give attention to what is being taught as these kids are highly distractible. But distractibility is not noticed in activities that interest them like watching a favourite cartoon show.
            Impulsivity is manifested as unable to wait for turns and picking up fights with others. ADHD children will often get blamed for doing something without proper thinking. They will make silly mistakes in their answer papers partly due to inattention and also due to writing answers impulsively without thinking.
            ADHD responds very well to medical management.</D>
